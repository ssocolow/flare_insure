# Technical Implementation

## Core Components

### Weather Data Reader Contract
- Interfaces directly with Flare's State Connector
- Responsible for fetching and validating weather data
- Maintains historical rainfall data through attestations
- Implements verification of Flare's data proofs
- Provides standardized data format for insurance calculations
- Supports multiple weather data types (rainfall, temperature, etc.)
- Caches verified weather data for gas optimization

Key Functions:
- Requests weather data attestations
- Verifies proofs from Flare's State Connector
- Maintains mapping of verified weather readings
- Provides getter functions for insurance contract queries

### Rainfall Insurance Contract
- Main contract handling insurance policies
- References the Weather Data Reader for verified data
- Manages policy lifecycle (creation, claims, payouts)
- Implements configurable insurance parameters
- Handles premium collection and payout distribution

Key Features:
- Policy creation with customizable parameters
  - Coverage period
  - Rainfall thresholds
  - Premium amounts
  - Payout calculations
- Automated claims processing
- Premium management
- Access control for admin functions
- Emergency pause functionality

## Contract Interaction Flow

1. Policy Creation:
   - User initiates policy creation with parameters
   - Contract validates parameters
   - Collects premium payment
   - Stores policy details

2. Weather Data Verification:
   - Weather Reader fetches data through State Connector
   - Verifies proofs and stores validated data
   - Makes data available for insurance calculations

3. Claims Processing:
   - Insurance contract queries Weather Reader
   - Validates claim conditions against stored data
   - Processes automatic payouts when conditions are met

## Security Considerations

### Weather Data Reader
- Implements proof verification
- Only accepts data from authorized Flare endpoints
- Includes circuit breakers for unusual data patterns
- Maintains data integrity checks

### Insurance Contract
- Access control for administrative functions
- Rate limiting for policy creation
- Secure premium handling
- Protected claim verification process
- Reentrancy protection for payouts

## System Architecture
```
User -> Insurance Contract -> Weather Reader -> Flare State Connector
                                           <- Verified Weather Data
         Insurance Contract <- Weather Data
User <- Payout/Status
```

## Future Improvements

- Multi-token support for premiums and payouts
- Enhanced weather data aggregation
- Dynamic premium calculation based on risk metrics
- Integration with additional weather parameters
- Cross-chain compatibility
